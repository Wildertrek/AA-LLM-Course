### **AI Catalog Hierarchy & Tree Structure**
To organize your **AI Catalog** with interconnected **AI Use-Case Cards, Model Cards, Dataset Cards, Agent Cards, and other documentation**, we can structure it into a hierarchical tree. The **AI Patterns** will emerge as cross-cutting elements across multiple components.

---
#### **📂 AI Catalog (Root)**
- 📂 **AI Use-Cases**

### **Key Structural Insights**
1. **AI Use-Case Cards act as the entry point** 🏛️  
   - These link to specific **Model Cards, Dataset Cards, Agent Cards**, and other artifacts.
   
2. **AI Patterns are cross-cutting across components** 🔄  
   - Example: RAG can be an **AI Pattern** that applies to both **Use-Cases (RAG Pipeline), AI Models (Embedding Model), and AI Agents (Retriever-Augmented Agent).**

3. **Evaluation, Deployment, and Governance are modular** 🔒  
   - Each AI Use-Case can reference centralized **Evaluation & Governance** materials to avoid duplication.

4. **Interoperability & Tooling capture integrations** 🛠️  
   - External APIs, fine-tuning strategies, and tool use should be tracked in **Tooling Cards**.

---
### **Next Steps**
1. **Finalize the AI Pattern List** → Define AI techniques that should be standardized across your AI systems.
2. **Standardize Metadata** → Ensure each card (AI Use-Case, Model, Dataset, Agent) has a consistent metadata format.
3. **Graph Representation (Neo4j)** → Represent AI Use-Cases, Models, Datasets, and Agents as a **knowledge graph** for better traceability and governance.
4. **Automation & Versioning** → Establish pipelines for auto-generating and updating cards based on model/data updates.
