| Parameter        | Description                                                                                       | Range/Values                  | Effect                                         |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Temperature**  | Controls randomness of output; higher values increase creativity, lower values make responses more focused.  | 0.0 to 1.0                    | Higher: More random, creative output. Lower: More focused, deterministic output.    |
| **Top-p**        | Limits output to the most probable tokens whose cumulative probability reaches **p**; works with temperature.   | 0.0 to 1.0                    | Lower: More selective, focused output. Higher: Allows broader token selection.       |
| **Max Tokens**   | Sets the maximum number of tokens to generate in the output.                                        | Integer (e.g., 1 to model limit) | Controls length of response; higher allows longer outputs.                           |
| **Frequency Penalty** | Adjusts tendency to repeat tokens; positive values reduce repetition, encouraging varied vocabulary.        | -2.0 to 2.0                   | Higher: Reduces repetition. Lower: Allows more repetition in output.                 |
| **Presence Penalty**  | Controls likelihood of introducing new topics; positive values encourage novel words or topics.          | -2.0 to 2.0                   | Higher: Increases novelty. Lower: Reduces novelty, focusing on existing topics.      |
| **Stop Sequences**    | Specifies sequences that signal the end of the output generation.                              | List of strings               | Ends response when specified sequences are generated.                                |
| **Logit Bias**        | Adjusts the probability of specific tokens, making them more or less likely to appear in output.         | -100 to 100                   | Positive: Increases likelihood. Negative: Decreases likelihood of specific tokens.   |
