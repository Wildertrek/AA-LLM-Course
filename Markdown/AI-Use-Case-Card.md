Below is a **generic AI Use-case Card** template that you can customize for any particular AI application. This card is designed to reference and link out to more detailed artifacts (e.g., Model Cards, Dataset Cards, Agent Cards) without duplicating their content. Feel free to adapt sections and headings as needed for your specific organization or project.

# **AI Use-case Card**

## **1. Use-case Overview**
- **Title:**  
  A short descriptive name for the AI application (e.g., *“Customer Support Chatbot,” “Document Summarization Pipeline”*).  
- **Objective/Goal:**  
  What problem does this AI solution solve? How does it fit into the broader product or organizational strategy?  
- **Key Features & Capabilities:**  
  A concise list of the main functionalities the solution provides.

## **2. Linked Artifacts**
Here, provide quick references to other important documentation. (Hyperlink or reference each card in your internal knowledge base or documentation system.)

- **Model Card(s):**  
  \[Link: *Model Card Name*\]  
  Briefly describe which model(s) are used in this AI solution and why.
  
- **Dataset Card(s):**  
  \[Link: *Dataset Card Name*\]  
  Summarize the data sources powering this use-case (training, validation, and/or inference data).
  
- **Agent Card(s):**  
  \[Link: *Agent Card Name*\]  
  If using AI agents (e.g., multi-step reasoning or autonomy), provide links to any agent-specific details.

- **Other Relevant Cards:**  
  E.g., *Evaluation Pipeline Card*, *Annotation Process Card*, *Ethical Review Card*, if applicable.

## **3. Target Audience & Stakeholders**
- **Primary Users:**  
  Who will use or benefit from this AI solution? (e.g., end customers, internal teams)  
- **Business Owners & Sponsors:**  
  Departments or individuals responsible for funding and oversight.  
- **Technical Teams:**  
  Data scientists, ML engineers, MLOps, DevOps teams involved in building and maintaining the solution.

## **4. Workflow & Architecture**
- **High-Level Workflow Diagram:**  
  Provide a simple flowchart or bullet points describing how data moves through the system, where the model is invoked, and how results are returned or used.
- **Integration Points:**  
  Systems or APIs that the AI solution relies on (e.g., CRM, data lake, microservices).  
- **Deployment Environment:**  
  On-premises, cloud platform, or edge devices.

## **5. Performance Expectations**
- **Key Metrics & KPIs:**  
  - Outline the top-line metrics you’re tracking (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, ROI, user satisfaction).  
  - Reference how these metrics relate to the Model Card’s reported performance if applicable.  
- **SLA or Latency Requirements:**  
  State any real-time or near-real-time constraints.  
- **Scalability Considerations:**  
  Expected load (queries per second, daily request volume) and how the solution scales.

## **6. Ethical & Legal Considerations**
- **Compliance & Regulations:**  
  Any industry-specific regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) that apply.  
- **Bias & Fairness:**  
  High-level discussion of potential biases or fairness concerns relevant to this use-case (link to Model Card’s “Bias Mitigation” section or the Dataset Card’s distribution details as needed).  
- **Privacy & Security:**  
  How you handle personal or sensitive data in this context.

## **7. Risk Assessment & Mitigation**
- **Potential Risks & Harms:**  
  - Misinformation, if the system generates text.  
  - Privacy leaks, if sensitive data is involved.  
  - Business or reputational risk if the model underperforms.  
- **Monitoring & Alerting:**  
  Strategies for detecting when the system is failing or producing harmful outputs.  
- **Failover & Human-in-the-Loop:**  
  Plans for human oversight or fallback strategies if automation fails.

## **8. Implementation & Testing**
- **Development Phases:**  
  Outline the steps (prototype, MVP, production) and timelines.  
- **Testing Strategy:**  
  - Unit tests, integration tests, acceptance tests.  
  - Reference your “Agent Card” if it covers multi-step testing or chain-of-thought integrity.  
- **Validation Set & Benchmarks:**  
  Link to relevant Dataset Cards for detailed splits and performance metrics.

## **9. Maintenance & Updates**
- **Versioning Strategy:**  
  How often will the model or dataset be updated? (Link to Model Card’s **“Update Strategy”** section if relevant.)  
- **Retraining & Refresh:**  
  Describe the frequency of retraining or dataset refresh cycles.  
- **Long-Term Ownership:**  
  Assign ownership for ongoing maintenance (e.g., MLOps team, product team).

## **10. User Guidance & Support**
- **End-User Documentation:**  
  Tutorials, FAQs, or user guides for non-technical users.  
- **Support Channels:**  
  Who to contact for issues, feedback, or further inquiries (e.g., Slack channel, email).  
- **Known Limitations:**  
  Any disclaimers, known failure modes, or usage constraints. (Link to the Model Card’s **“Caveats & Recommendations”** section.)

### **Next Steps**
- **Finalize Links:** Ensure each reference to the Model Card, Dataset Card, Agent Card, etc., is hyperlinked in your knowledge base or documentation portal.  
- **Schedule Reviews:** Align with stakeholders for ethical, legal, and technical sign-offs before deploying.  
- **Iterate & Update:** This Use-case Card should evolve as the model or application changes over time.

Use this template as a flexible starting point. Your **AI Use-case Card** acts as the “hub” for stakeholders to understand not only *what* the application does, but also *how* and *why*, with direct connections to the deeper technical and ethical details housed in the Model Card, Dataset Card, Agent Card, and other specialized documentation.
