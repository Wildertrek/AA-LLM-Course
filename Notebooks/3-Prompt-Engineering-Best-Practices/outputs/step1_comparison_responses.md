### Chest pain in adults can be caused by a variety of conditions, ranging from benign to life-threatening. Here are some common causes:

1. **Cardiac Causes:**
- **Angina:** Reduced blood flow to the heart muscle, often due to coronary artery disease.
- **Myocardial Infarction (Heart Attack):** Blockage of blood flow to the heart muscle.
- **Pericarditis:** Inflammation of the pericardium, the sac surrounding the heart.
- **Myocarditis:** Inflammation of the heart muscle.
- **Aortic Dissection:** A tear in the inner layer of the aorta.

2. **Gastrointestinal Causes:**
- **Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD):** Acid reflux causing heartburn and chest pain.
- **Esophageal Spasm:** Abnormal contractions of the esophagus.
- **Peptic Ulcer Disease:** Sores in the lining of the stomach or duodenum.
- **Gallbladder Disease:** Such as gallstones or cholecystitis.

3. **Pulmonary Causes:**
- **Pulmonary Embolism:** A blood clot in the lungs.
- **Pneumonia:** Infection of the lungs.
- **Pleuritis (Pleurisy):** Inflammation of the pleura, the lining around the lungs.
- **Pneumothorax:** Collapsed lung.

4. **Musculoskeletal Causes:**
- **Costochondritis:** Inflammation of the cartilage connecting the ribs to the sternum.
- **Muscle Strain:** Overuse or injury to the chest muscles.

5. **Psychological Causes:**
- **Panic Attack:** Sudden onset of intense fear or discomfort, often with chest pain.
- **Anxiety Disorders:** Chronic anxiety can sometimes manifest as chest pain.

6. **Other Causes:**
- **Herpes Zoster (Shingles):** Viral infection that can cause chest pain if it affects the nerves in the chest area.
- **Thoracic Outlet Syndrome:** Compression of nerves or blood vessels in the upper chest.

It's important to seek medical evaluation for chest pain, especially if it is severe, persistent, or accompanied by other symptoms like shortness of breath, dizziness, or radiating pain, as these could indicate a serious condition.

Chest pain can be indicative of a wide range of conditions, from benign to life-threatening. It's important to consider the nature of the pain (sharp, dull, crushing, burning), its location, duration, and any accompanying symptoms like shortness of breath, nausea, or sweating. If chest pain is severe, sudden, or accompanied by other concerning symptoms, seeking immediate medical attention is crucial. Remember, this list isn't exhaustive, and only a healthcare provider can provide a definitive diagnosis.
