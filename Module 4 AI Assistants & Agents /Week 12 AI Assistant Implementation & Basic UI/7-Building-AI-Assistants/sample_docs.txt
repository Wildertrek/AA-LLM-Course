# Section 1: MEAN Stack Architecture Overview
Our company uses a MEAN stack implementation with MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js. This stack supports AI applications with database integrations such as PostgreSQL (for structured data), Neo4j (for graph relationships), OpenSearch (for retrieval), and HyperLedger (for blockchain-based governance).

# Section 2: LangChain Retrieval Process
LangChain enables retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by integrating with vector stores. MongoDB is used to store embeddings, while OpenSearch indexes documents for fast retrieval. The process involves:
1. Converting text into embeddings using OpenAI models.
2. Storing embeddings in FAISS (MongoDB-based vector store).
3. Querying OpenSearch for the most relevant documents.

# Section 3: Sample Queries
Query: "What are the best practices for integrating Neo4j with LangChain?"
Response: "Neo4j can be integrated with LangChain's GraphRAG by using Cypher queries to fetch structured knowledge. Example Cypher query:
MATCH (n)-[r]->(m) RETURN n, r, m LIMIT 10."

# Section 4: HyperLedger Smart Contracts
HyperLedger provides a secure mechanism for AI auditing and compliance. Smart contracts allow:
- Decentralized AI decision-making.
- Secure transaction logging for AI interactions.
- Enforcing data governance and security policies.

# Section 5: Security & Compliance (FedRAMP)
All AI models deployed within the organization must comply with NIST SP 800-53. Key access control policies include:
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
- Encryption of sensitive data at rest and in transit.
- AI model transparency and explainability.

# Section 6: Troubleshooting Example
Issue: "The RAG pipeline is returning incorrect context."
Solution:
1. Check OpenSearch indexing for missing embeddings.
2. Validate that FAISS is correctly retrieving relevant vector embeddings.
3. Tune query similarity thresholds for improved results.
